    "windows. The squeals of the “special” newsboys and the hansom-whistles\n",
    "of the early diners-out splashed across the blur and din, standing out\n",
    "against the immeasurable roar as against a silence. The heat of a London\n",
    "summer lay heavily over us; the undying rattle of wheels beat up to us\n",
    "wearily, the mid-season blare and hurry of town echoing irritatingly in\n",
    "their jingle and clatter as they streamed ceaselessly by. The stew and\n",
    "hubbub of the afternoon enclosed us as with a pall of depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "By us I mean Gerry and myself. Flung back listlessly was I in my club\n",
    "chair, and watching him as he strolled monotonously up and down before\n",
    "the great bow-window that gave upon Pall Mall. His hands were scabbarded\n",
    "hilt high in his pockets. His brows and the corners of his eyes were\n",
    "hard and wrinkled. His gaze was cast steadfastly before his toes. He did\n",
    "a very sentry-go of moody vexation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time he paused, as he turned against the light, every wrinkle and\n",
    "line was silhouetted mercilessly. Wretchedness covered his face as with\n",
    "a mask. My heart began to go out to him, bursting through its own crust\n",
    "of dejection. Wretched we both were, but I was seven years his senior. I\n",
    "began to commune with myself, seeking comfort for him out of my own\n",
    "hard-won store of disappointment, and trying to forget that our sorrows\n",
    "sat upon an even base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly he turned towards me and broke the silence that had lasted\n",
    "between us the greater part of the afternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well,” he said harshly, “that’s the end of most things for me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Possibly,” answered I, “but probably not. The future’s very spacious\n",
    "yet, my dear boy. I don’t say it in any patronizing spirit, but you’re\n",
    "only twenty-four. Try to forget the ‘might-have-been,’ and buck yourself\n",
    "up into imagining the ‘maybe.’ It’s not all over yet.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He grunted contemptuously, tramping off again upon his beat. A waiter\n",
    "who chanced in with the evening papers coughed ostentatiously, and with\n",
    "obvious intention towards the cloud of dust that followed hard upon his\n",
    "track. Gerry stared him down, and as the door closed behind him, brought\n",
    "himself to anchor before me again.\n",
    "\n",
    "“That’s all rot, and you know it, Jack,” he said dogmatically. “Do you\n",
    "think I’m going to stay here and see Vi come back another man’s wife?\n",
    "I’m sick of it all—sick of the work, sick of the play. Deathly sick of\n",
    "the utter sameness of what we call life. I’m going to chuck it, I tell\n",
    "you. Hausa Police, Egyptian Army, Hong Kong Regiment—something of the\n",
    "kind I’m going to try. There’s nothing most assuredly to keep me any\n",
    "longer in her Majesty’s Foot Guards. I’m dipped, and I’ve lost the one\n",
    "thing that might have kept me to the collar. Great Heavens! what in the\n",
    "name of goodness _should_ I stay for?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I stared back at him answerless. I knew he was talking a cheap sentiment\n",
    "which a month or two later he would be the first to despise. I too was\n",
    "feeling in a modified form all he felt. To me had also come the animal\n",
    "desire for action that follows hard upon mental stress. But that seven\n",
    "years made the difference. Though that day had brought me the supreme\n",
    "discontent of my life, I was still aware that the world continued to\n",
    "wag, and that we should swing along with it. Yet how could I comfort\n",
    "without offending?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the reason of all this affliction was simple enough and old as time.\n",
    "To each of us had come the desire of his life, and to each had it been\n",
    "denied. That morning we had spent at the Albert Docks, and had seen a\n",
    "tall ship sail out for foreign lands, bearing upon her decks two maidens\n",
    "who were taking with them our hearts to the world’s end.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never was much of a chap for lover’s rhapsodies, so I will make no\n",
    "effort to explain to you how sweet a girl was Gwen Delahay, nor why she\n",
    "held my heart in the hollow of her hand. She was one of the many good\n",
    "and beautiful women—God bless them—who walk this earth, and are to their\n",
    "lovers peerless. And as I worshipped her, so did Gerry worship Vi, her\n",
    "sister—a thing perhaps inexplicable, in that he had seen Gwen, but one\n",
    "to be truly thankful for, seeing that we were friends beyond the\n",
    "ordinary sympathies of life. And now were we left hopeless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plain Captain Dorinecourte was I, with a slender six hundred pounds\n",
    "beyond my pay, and Gerry, poor lad, had less. You will not exhaust\n",
    "yourself with wonder then, when I relate the fact that Lady Delahay\n",
    "declined on behalf of her daughters our attentions, contemned our\n",
    "eligibility, and hated poisonously the sight of our ingenuous faces. For\n",
    "all these things, I take it, a Society mother is bound by her allegiance\n",
    "to Society to do. Yet though we felt that she played the game as we\n",
    "understood it, none the less did we cry out upon our luck in being the\n",
    "losers. And now it seemed that we might well throw down our cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fond mother’s fears of the blight which our undivided attentions\n",
    "might throw upon her daughters’ careers had culminated that morning. A\n",
    "month before an announcement in the _Morning Post_ had spurred her to an\n",
    "action which her fear alone would never have conceived. It ran as\n",
    "follows—\n",
    "\n",
    "“Among the passengers by the s.s. _Madagascar_, which sails on August 4\n",
    "for her winter’s cruise around the world, will be the Earl of Denvarre.\n",
    "His lordship will be accompanied by his brother the Hon. Stephen\n",
    "Garlicke.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This item of intelligence had caught the dutiful mother’s eye, and taken\n",
    "vigorous root in her somewhat languid intelligence. Two eligible young\n",
    "men were to be shut up for eight or nine months in a space not more than\n",
    "one hundred yards long by twenty wide. Walking lawlessly in London were\n",
    "two extremely ineligible youths, unchained, ready and willing to wreck\n",
    "her daughters’ happiness. Why not extract the victims from this\n",
    "hazardous propinquity, placing them at the same time in the financially\n",
    "commendable vicinitude of a live earl and his brother. Action was born\n",
    "only too rapidly from reflection. We had seen them off that very\n",
    "morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there sat we in the desolation of a mere club, disconsolate amid the\n",
    "roar of the city, while the sunset became the twilight, the shadows of\n",
    "the lamp-posts lengthened, and darkness fell upon the town even as upon\n",
    "our hearts. And out of the plenitude of my regret I failed to find the\n",
    "word of sympathetic comfort for Gerry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lost in our heavy-hearted musings, it was past eight when we realized\n",
    "that food was yet a distasteful necessity of existence, and sought the\n",
    "club dinner. Silently we entered the dining-room, Gerry with the air of\n",
    "one who approached poisoned dishes, and chose a table apart. Though the\n",
    "soup and sherry warmed my companion to conversation, it had a bias of\n",
    "marked contempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clubs, he showed beyond dispute, were traps for the unwary, committees\n",
    "were things of naught, secretaries insolent and overpaid. Waiters were\n",
    "plucked from the gutter to be trained in pot-houses, and cooks cherished\n",
    "the idea that to evolve a savoury it was but necessary to taint an olive\n",
    "with a decayed anchovy. Women who were guests of brother members—it was\n",
    "Wednesday night—were all dressed in seventeen tints of garish atrocity,\n",
    "and were of a mediocrity of feature which he plainly condemned. He\n",
    "mentioned the names of no less than six social resorts off which he\n",
    "purposed to take his name in the morning. This, of course, preparatory\n",
    "to stirring activities which would remove him beyond their sphere of\n",
    "usefulness. Still soured, but evidently relieved, he then retired behind\n",
    "the sheets of the _Westminster_, with which he screened himself from\n",
    "further intercourse with his fellows. Apathetically I proceeded with my\n",
    "repast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly the decorum of the room received a shock. A sound burst from\n",
    "Gerry’s throat which I can only term a crow. He endeavored frantically\n",
    "and indecently to masticate the portion which he had placed between his\n",
    "teeth, beating the paper at me furiously. The sounds which continued to\n",
    "issue from his lips were such as no one could approve. He mouthed\n",
    "unutterable things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hastily I rose and thumped him on the back, and noticed that his finger\n",
    "continued to tap viciously upon a headline which he thrust into my face.\n",
    "As the distressing symptoms modified themselves he gradually found his\n",
    "breath, but ceased not to bulge his eyes upon me.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look, old man, look,” he insisted faintly, and I took the paper from\n",
    "his hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We regret to announce the death of Viscount Heatherslie at Greytown,\n",
    "Central America. His lordship had lately been travelling in the\n",
    "vicinity, and his death is ascribed to malarial fever. As yet no details\n",
    "can be ascertained.”—_Reuter._\n",
    "\n",
    "The words turned red before my eyes as they danced up and down the green\n",
    "columns. Uncle Leonard was dead—was dead. And I—well, I had to think it\n",
    "very hard indeed before I dared repeat it silently even to myself—I was\n",
    "Lord Heatherslie. Only one thought had possession of my mind. Not a\n",
    "regret did I spare for the dead, not a single reflection as to what this\n",
    "thing meant to me or my prospects did I give beyond the fact that my\n",
    "luck—my cursed Irish luck—had been too late. That one idea had hold of\n",
    "me. A week earlier—a few hours earlier, and what might have been?—what\n",
    "might have been? A curse snarled from between my teeth as I sat down\n",
    "again to stare white-faced across at Gerry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The excitement had died from his face. His sympathy was quicker than\n",
    "mine had been. He stretched his hand across the table and gripped mine\n",
    "hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Frightful luck, old chap,” he murmured; “I know what you’re thinking.\n",
    "But—but it needn’t be too late yet, Jack.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I shook my head. Things had become blurred in my brain, but one fact\n",
    "stood out bright as a searchlight to my mind’s eye. Gwen was going out\n",
    "of my life, going away from me as fast as breeze and steam would take\n",
    "her. And the thing that might have stayed our separation—have given her\n",
    "to me—was a week—nay, only a day—too late. I could have smitten my head\n",
    "against the wall in my agony of disappointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet I had resigned Gwen as fatalistically as any son of Islam. I had\n",
    "schooled myself to think of her as already belonging to another. I had\n",
    "bidden her good-bye without a quiver. Even the look she had given me at\n",
    "the last—a tender, questioning look it was too, and straight from her\n",
    "heart through her dear eyes—I had met with a smile that told of nothing.\n",
    "To me the hopelessness of it all had come home long days before, and I\n",
    "simply wouldn’t sadden the poor child and prolong the pain of parting. I\n",
    "meant that parting to be the absolute separation of our lives—one that\n",
    "should leave no dropped threads to be gathered up in future days of\n",
    "further hopelessness.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now—now I had the right to win her, and honourably. Only a soldier I\n",
    "might be, but I had a place of my own to take a wife to. Nor would she\n",
    "come to me to sink into a nobody. Half a county would welcome Lady\n",
    "Heatherslie, though half that county might be in rags. Poor we should\n",
    "always have been, but not desperately. Modestly we should have had to\n",
    "live, but we could have kept our rank befittingly. And now the chance\n",
    "was gone. Away beyond the seas she would set herself to forget me, and\n",
    "Denvarre would show her how. The black curses fell over each other in\n",
    "their haste to reach my tongue, and the salt tears nigh fled out along\n",
    "with them. I made an effort and pulled myself together.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Come along,” said I hoarsely to Gerry in a voice that I hardly knew\n",
    "myself, and blundered out of the room. Without another word I crept into\n",
    "the hansom the commissionaire called, and together we drove down the\n",
    "glaring streets to my rooms, Gerry offering no sympathy but a silence\n",
    "which I understood and was grateful for.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know the heavy, choking pain that lies leaden in your throat when\n",
    "one you love has gone out into the emptiness—the desperate unbelief in\n",
    "your torture—the mad hope that insists that this thing is too horrible\n",
    "to bear. My suffering came home to me like that. I could only think of\n",
    "Gwen as of one dead and gone from me, but with the added agony of\n",
    "knowing that to me she might have been life and love itself. I felt that\n",
    "I could beat the air, wrestling with my fate for my desire. I gasped,\n",
    "unmanned with wretchedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Gerry rose and put his hand upon my shoulder. Here again his\n",
    "selfishness was seven years younger than mine. He could lose his sorrow\n",
    "in sympathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“God be good to you, dear old chap,” he said; “it’s desperate, desperate\n",
    "luck, but after all _is_ it too late? You’ve the place, the title, and\n",
    "all that—and after all, you know, the old boy might have come home and\n",
    "married any day—why can’t you follow them? Surely you might drop in with\n",
    "them somewhere.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Too late? Of course it’s too late,” said I bitterly. “Is a girl to wait\n",
    "for ever? Besides, they can’t hear of it for weeks—very likely not at\n",
    "all. By then Denvarre will have settled matters, if he isn’t the most\n",
    "consummate idiot on earth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“That may be all very well about Denvarre,” quoth Gerry wisely, “though\n",
    "I don’t see that it is for certain, all the same. But what about Gwen?\n",
    "You don’t allow her much independence of thought. Why should he happen\n",
    "to meet her fancy? Do you think she doesn’t _know_ you worship the\n",
    "ground she walks on?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I stared at him, gnawing uneasily at my moustache, and with the sense\n",
    "that he spoke the truth. Gwen knew it—must know it, but she must have\n",
    "seen, as did I, the hopelessness of the business—must have known that\n",
    "the farewell of that morning was to be the end. And yet—and yet that\n",
    "look she gave me. Was it merely questioning, or did it tell me\n",
    "something? I fell into that moody, unhealthy mind when one forbids\n",
    "oneself to hope for very hope of being mistaken—assuring myself that I\n",
    "knew there could be nothing but despair for me in the future, trusting\n",
    "all the same that wanton fate would prove me wrong. Which is a phase of\n",
    "unreason, I take it, more wearing than an utter yielding to desperation.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, old chap,” went on Gerry soberly, “if you begin to muse and wonder\n",
    "you’ll never sleep to-night. I believe this thing comes in the light of\n",
    "luck for both of us. I feel twice the man I did half-an-hour ago, and\n",
    "I’m going to whine no more. However matters go you’re very much better\n",
    "off than you were this morning, and, as I said before, what’s to prove\n",
    "that either Gwen or Vi may not come back to us again? Heaps of things\n",
    "may happen in a year. Why,” he went on smiling, “with the influence of\n",
    "the Heatherslies at my back I mean to get an _attachéship_ and marry Vi\n",
    "myself. At any rate I believe now that the game’s _not_ over. I’ll be\n",
    "your best man yet, unless we’re both married together, and I won’t say\n",
    "that’s not possible.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It was good to hear him say it, but all the time I was telling myself\n",
    "frantically that it was rot—that I mustn’t listen to him, and I backed\n",
    "my inward despondency with the spoken word.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But even now,” I demurred, “what am I but a pauper peer? Fifty thousand\n",
    "acres of bog are mine, and a few English farms. What’s that to\n",
    "Denvarre’s forty thousand pounds a year and Gleivdon? I’d take an offer\n",
    "of five thousand pounds a year for all I possess.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He rose and slapped me on the back cheerily, smiling as he reached for\n",
    "his hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There, there,” said he, “that’s quite enough, Jack. I’m off, and you’re\n",
    "going to tumble in. You’ll be twice the man in the morning. You’re upset\n",
    "with it all, and to-morrow when you’re a bit steadied you’ll see it all\n",
    "in another light. We’ll have a long collogue about it then, and you’ll\n",
    "know what you’re going to do. Night-night, old man, and don’t dream if\n",
    "you can help it,” and he passed across to his rooms whistling, though I\n",
    "could but notice it was a very reedy, quivering attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of Gerry’s veto I did dream that night, seeing Denvarre in many\n",
    "a heroic attitude save Gwen from desperate perils by flood and\n",
    "field—masterful deeds which I could only watch in restless helplessness.\n",
    "I rode a nightmare which trampled my every aspiration in the mud of\n",
    "desolation, leaving me to awake heavy-eyed and low-spirited, but yet, as\n",
    "Gerry predicted, with some of the hope that each new day brings. And\n",
    "after my bath—and what a mental as well as bodily tonic a cold bath is—I\n",
    "was chastened, maybe, but myself again. I filled my clothes without\n",
    "feeling three sizes too small for them, and ate my breakfast with\n",
    "appetite. As I was at it, Barker brought in a telegram. I ripped the\n",
    "dirty orange-colored paper and read, “Please call at your earliest\n",
    "convenience. Meadows and Crum.”\n",
    "\n",
    "They are our lawyers—have been for generations. My former meetings with\n",
    "them had been, for the most part, embarrassing. Hunted by some\n",
    "pertinacious dun, I had occasionally fled to their chambers in Lincoln’s\n",
    "Inn Fields as to a sanctuary, and they had always responded nobly to my\n",
    "appeals. I smiled to think how continually and tactfully they had warned\n",
    "me against backing other men’s bills and such-like futilities. Well, at\n",
    "any rate that sort of thing was over. As a bachelor—I still assured\n",
    "myself that I should live and die celibate, with an eye to the possible\n",
    "fate which might be listening—I should not be so badly off. I could look\n",
    "forward to commanding the regiment some day without beggaring myself.\n",
    "Little rifts of sunlight like this began to break through the fog of my\n",
    "depression, and when I strolled forth to call upon my solicitors, I had\n",
    "pretty well regained the self-possession which that sudden announcement\n",
    "of a tardy good luck had knocked completely out of my system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crum received me. Meadows is an anachronistic figment of the imagination\n",
    "long deposited in a Hampstead vault. His partner continues the business\n",
    "with other partners, who are considered to be sufficiently dignified by\n",
    "the title of Co. He is a benignant old man, with an unblemished bald\n",
    "head and character. I believe a warm heart beats under his deliberation,\n",
    "and he has shown good faith and personal service to my family for more\n",
    "years than I dare say he cares to count. He welcomed me with a quaint\n",
    "subdued tolerance hovering on the outskirts of the chastened air he\n",
    "thought befitting the mournful occasion. For myself I will say frankly\n",
    "and at once that I could pretend no regret for the accident which led to\n",
    "my being Crum’s future client. I had never even seen my uncle since I\n",
    "was at Eton. In point of fact I felt the matter to be, personally, only\n",
    "one for self-gratulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Desperately sudden, my lord,” quoth the old gentleman, making me twitch\n",
    "in my chair as I heard myself addressed by my title for the first time,\n",
    "“desperately sudden. We received advises from his late lordship on\n",
    "financial matters only a week ago, and now—it’s come like a thunderclap,\n",
    "I assure you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“These are matters of fate, my dear Mr. Crum,” said I piously. “I\n",
    "suppose there’s no doubt about the report?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“None whatever, as I learn this morning. We cabled his lordship’s valet\n",
    "last night and got the press message confirmed. Death took place\n",
    "up-country, it seems. Baines, his man, talks of bringing the body to the\n",
    "coast and sailing next week by the Pacific Mail Steamer.”\n",
    "\n",

    "features of the face appeared to him as his own, and the answer was\n",
    "that of a highborn youth; furthermore, it seemed to him that the time\n",
    "of the exposure agreed with the boy’s age. This smote his heart, and he\n",
    "remained speechless for a while. Hardly had he regained control over\n",
    "himself, when he spoke to get rid of Artembares, so as to be able to\n",
    "question the cattle herder without witnesses. “My dear Artembares,”\n",
    "he said, “I shall take care that neither thou nor thy son shall have\n",
    "cause for complaint.” Thus he dismissed Artembares. Kyros, however, was\n",
    "led into the palace by the servants, on the command of Astyages, and\n",
    "the cattle herder had to stay behind. When he was all alone with him\n",
    "Astyages questioned him whence he had obtained the boy, and who had\n",
    "given the child into his hands. But the herder said that he was his own\n",
    "son, and that the woman who had borne him was living with him. Astyages\n",
    "remarked that he was very unwise, to look out for most cruel tortures,\n",
    "and he beckoned the sword bearers to take hold of him. As he was being\n",
    "led to torture, the herder confessed the whole story, from beginning to\n",
    "end, the entire truth, finally beginning to beg and implore forgiveness\n",
    "and pardon. Meanwhile Astyages was not so incensed against the herder,\n",
    "who had revealed to him the truth, as against Harpagos; he ordered\n",
    "the sword bearers to summon him, and when Harpagos stood before him,\n",
    "Astyages asked him as follows: “My dear Harpagos, in what fashion hast\n",
    "thou taken the life of my daughter’s son, whom I once delivered over to\n",
    "thee?” Seeing the cattle herder standing near, Harpagos did not resort\n",
    "to untruthfulness, for fear that he would be refuted at once, and so he\n",
    "proceeded to tell the truth. Astyages concealed the anger which he had\n",
    "aroused in him, and first told him what he had learned from the herder;\n",
    "then he mentioned that the boy was still living, and that everything\n",
    "had turned out all right. He said that he had greatly regretted what he\n",
    "had done to the child, and that his daughter’s reproaches had pierced\n",
    "his soul. “But as everything has ended so well, send thy son to greet\n",
    "the newcomer, and then come to eat with me, for I am ready to prepare a\n",
    "feast in honor of the Gods who have brought all this about.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When Harpagos heard this, he prostrated himself on the ground before\n",
    "the king, and praised himself for his error having turned out well,\n",
    "and for being invited to the king’s table, in commemoration of a happy\n",
    "event. So he went home, and when he arrived there, he at once sent\n",
    "off his only son, a boy of about thirteen years, telling him to go to\n",
    "Astyages, and to do as he was bid. Then Harpagos joyfully told his wife\n",
    "what had befallen him. But Astyages butchered the son of Harpagos when\n",
    "he came, cut him to pieces, and roasted the flesh in part; another\n",
    "portion of the flesh was cooked, and when everything was prepared he\n",
    "kept it in readiness. When the hour of the meal had come, Harpagos\n",
    "and the other guests arrived. A table with sheep’s meat was arranged\n",
    "in front of Astyages and the others, but Harpagos was served with his\n",
    "own son’s flesh, without the head, and without the choppings of hands\n",
    "and feet, but with everything else. These parts were kept hidden in a\n",
    "basket. When Harpagos seemed to have taken his fill, Astyages asked him\n",
    "if the meat had tasted good to him, and when Harpagos answered that he\n",
    "had enjoyed it, the servants, who had been ordered to do so, brought\n",
    "in his own son’s covered head, with the hands and feet, stepped up to\n",
    "Harpagos, and told him to uncover and take what he desired. Harpagos\n",
    "did so, uncovered the basket, and saw the remnants of his son. When he\n",
    "saw this, he did not give way to his horror, but controlled himself.\n",
    "Astyages then asked him if he knew of what game he had eaten; and he\n",
    "replied that he knew it very well, and that whatever the king did was\n",
    "well done. Thus he spoke, took the flesh that remained, and went home\n",
    "with it, where he probably meant to bury it together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the revenge of Astyages upon Harpagos. Concerning Kyros, he\n",
    "took counsel, and summoned the same magicians who had explained his\n",
    "dream, then he asked them how they had at one time interpreted his\n",
    "vision in a dream. But they said that the boy must become a king, if he\n",
    "remained alive, and did not die prematurely. Astyages made reply: “The\n",
    "boy is alive, and is here, and as he was staying in the country, the\n",
    "boys of the village elected him for their king. But he did everything\n",
    "like the real kings, for he ordained to himself as the master, sword\n",
    "bearers, gate keepers, messengers, and everything. How do you mean to\n",
    "interpret this?” The magicians made reply: “If the boy is alive, and\n",
    "has been made king without the help of anyone, thou canst be at ease\n",
    "so far as he is concerned, and be of good cheer, for he will not again\n",
    "be made a king. Already several prophecies of ours have applied to\n",
    "insignificant trifles, and what rests upon dreams is apt to be vain.”\n",
    "Astyages made reply: “Ye sorcerers, I am entirely of your opinion that\n",
    "the dream has been fulfilled when the boy was king in name, and that\n",
    "I have nothing more to fear from him. Yet counsel me carefully as to\n",
    "what is safest for my house and for yourselves.” Then the magicians\n",
    "said: “Send the boy away, that he may get out of thy sight, send him\n",
    "to the land of the Persians, to his parents.” When Astyages had heard\n",
    "this, he was greatly pleased. He sent for Kyros, and said to him: “My\n",
    "son, I have wronged thee greatly, misled by a deceitful dream, but\n",
    "thy good fortune has saved thee. Now go cheerfully to the land of\n",
    "the Persians; I shall give thee safe conduct. There wilt thou find a\n",
    "very different father, and a very different mother than the herders,\n",
    "Mithradates and his wife.” Thus spake Astyages, and Kyros was sent\n",
    "away. When he arrived in the house of Kambyses, his parents received\n",
    "him with great joy when they learned who he was, for they believed him\n",
    "to have perished at that time, and they desired to know how he had been\n",
    "preserved. He told them that he had believed himself to be the son\n",
    "of the cattle herder, but had learned everything on the way from the\n",
    "companions whom Astyages had sent with him. He related that the cattle\n",
    "herder’s wife had saved him, and praised her throughout. The bitch\n",
    "(Spako) played the principal part in his conversation. The parents took\n",
    "hold of this name, so that the preservation of the child might appear\n",
    "still more wonderful, and thus was laid the foundation of the myth that\n",
    "the exposed Kyros was nursed by a bitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, Kyros, on the instigation of Harpagos, stirred up the\n",
    "Persians against the Medes. War was declared, and Kyros, at the head\n",
    "of the Persians, conquered the Medes in battle. Astyages was taken a\n",
    "prisoner alive, but Kyros did not harm him, but kept him with him until\n",
    "his end. Herodotus’s report concludes with the words: “But from that\n",
    "time on the Persians and Kyros reigned over Asia. Thus was Kyros born\n",
    "and raised, and made a king.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The report of Pompeius Trogus is preserved only in the extract by\n",
    "Justinus.[46] Astyages had a daughter but no male heir. In his dream he\n",
    "saw a vine grow forth from her lap, the sprouts of which overshadowed\n",
    "all Asia. The dream interpreters declared that the vision signified the\n",
    "magnitude of his grandson, whom his daughter was to bear; but also his\n",
    "own loss of his dominions. In order to banish this dread, Astyages gave\n",
    "his daughter in marriage neither to a prominent man, nor to a Mede, so\n",
    "that his grandson’s mind might not be uplifted by the paternal estate\n",
    "besides the maternal; but he married her to Kambyses, a middle-class\n",
    "man from the then unknown people of the Persians. But this was not\n",
    "enough to banish the fears of Astyages, and he summoned his pregnant\n",
    "daughter, in order to have her infant destroyed before his eyes. When a\n",
    "boy had been born, he gave him to Harpagos, his friend and confidant,\n",
    "to kill him. For fear that the daughter of Astyages would take revenge\n",
    "upon him for the death of her boy, when she came to reign after her\n",
    "father’s death, he delivered the boy to the king’s herder for exposure.\n",
    "At the same time when Kyros was born, a son happened to be born also\n",
    "to the herder. When his wife learned that the king’s child had been\n",
    "exposed, she urgently prayed for it to be brought to her, that she\n",
    "might look at it. Moved by her entreaties, the herder returned to the\n",
    "woods. There he found a bitch standing beside the child, giving it her\n",
    "teats, and keeping the beasts and birds away from it. At this aspect he\n",
    "was filled with the same compassion as the bitch; so that he picked\n",
    "up the boy and carried him home, the bitch following him in great\n",
    "distress. When his wife took the boy in her arms, he smiled at her as\n",
    "if he already knew her; and as he was very strong, and ingratiated\n",
    "himself with her by his pleasant smile, she voluntarily begged the\n",
    "herder to (expose her own child instead and)[47] permit her to raise\n",
    "the boy; be it that she was interested in his welfare, or that she\n",
    "placed her hopes on him. Thus the two boys had to exchange fates; one\n",
    "was raised in place of the herder’s child, while the other was exposed\n",
    "instead of the grandson of the king.\"\"\""

Flesch-Kincaid relies on an implicit definition of a \"word\" and a \"sentence\", and different definitions will yield different grade level estimates. (In the problem definition above, we've already ruled out punctuation as constituing stand-alone words, and other assumptions lurk with every tokenization method). State your assumptions for the definition of \"word\" you have implemented and why they are reasonable."
